# DataBazaar


## Introduction

### DataBazaar is an anynoumous & AI Powered Dataset Marketplace, aiming to provide a platform for data scientists to connect with data providers and access quality-checked datasets for their projects. 

## The problem
### Data scientists often face the challenge of finding quality datasets for their projects. The process of finding and verifying datasets can be time-consuming and costly. Data providers, on the other hand, may have valuable datasets but face the problem of privacy, and rewards for selling their data.


## What does DataBazaar solve?

- ### The platform is designed to use bitcoin as the payment method to ensure anonymity and security for the providers. Only wallet address is used to transfer the rewards, which cannot be used to reveal the identity of the data provider.

- ### Users seeking datasets will raise a request, the requests will be visible for the data providers (contributors), and they can submit their datasets. The datasets will be checked for quality using the Anomaly Detection and Outlier Detection algorithms, and the quality score will be calculated.

- ### These algos will just give a score for reference, and the final decision can be taken by the dataset requester based on this score. The reward credits will be transferred to the data providers based on the quality of the dataset which was measured using the algos.
